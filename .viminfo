	# Exact Solarized color theme for the color GNU ls utility.
	# Designed for dircolors (GNU coreutils) 5.97
	#
	# This simple theme was simultaneously designed for these terminal color schemes:
	# - Solarized dark  (best)
	# - Solarized light (best)
	# - default dark
	# - default light
	#
	# How the colors were selected:
	# - Terminal emulators often have an option typically enabled by default that makes
	#   bold a different color.  It is important to leave this option enabled so that
	#   you can access the entire 16-color Solarized palette, and not just 8 colors.
	# - We favor universality over a greater number of colors.  So we limit the number
	#   of colors so that this theme will work out of the box in all terminals,
	#   Solarized or not, dark or light.
	# - We choose to have the following category of files:
	#   NORMAL & FILE, DIR, LINK, EXEC and
	#   editable text including source, unimportant text, binary docs & multimedia source
	#   files, viewable multimedia, archived/compressed, and unimportant non-text
	# - For uniqueness, we stay away from the Solarized foreground colors are -- either
	#   base00 (brightyellow) or base0 (brightblue).  However, they can be used if
	#   you know what the bg/fg colors of your terminal are, in order to optimize the display.
	# - 3 different options are provided: universal, solarized dark, and solarized light.
	#   The only difference between the universal scheme and one that's optimized for
	#   dark/light is the color of "unimportant" files, which should blend more with the
	#   background
	# - We note that blue is the hardest color to see on dark bg and yellow is the hardest
	#   color to see on light bg (with blue being particularly bad).  So we choose yellow
	#   for multimedia files which are usually accessed in a GUI folder browser anyway.
	#   And blue is kept for custom use of this scheme's user.
	# - See table below to see the assignments.
	
	
	# Installation instructions:
	# This file goes in the /etc directory, and must be world readable.
	# You can copy this file to .dir_colors in your $HOME directory to override
	# the system defaults.
	
	# COLOR needs one of these arguments: 'tty' colorizes output to ttys, but not
	# pipes. 'all' adds color characters to all output. 'none' shuts colorization
	# off.
